## ⚠️ Error Handling

* ❌ Invalid username → "user not found"
* ❌ API failure → "failed to fetch data"
* ❌ No activity → "no recent activity found"
* ❌ Rate limit exceeded → "github api rate limit exceeded"

---

## 🧠 Tech Stack

* Go (Golang)
* GitHub REST API
* Clean Architecture (DDD inspired)
* CLI Interface
* Net/http package (no external libraries)

---

## 🏗️ Architecture Highlights

* 🔹 Domain-driven structure
* 🔹 Dependency Injection (manual)
* 🔹 Interface-based design
* 🔹 Separation of concerns (CLI / Service / Infra)

---

## 🔥 Future Improvements

* 🎯 Add caching for repeated users
* ⏱️ Add rate limit handling & retry logic
* 🎨 Colored and formatted CLI output
* 📊 Group events by type (Push / Star / Issue)
* 🔐 GitHub token support for higher API limits
* 🧪 Unit tests with mocked GitHub client
